Random dojo to try out websocket in ruby using cramp to understand how websocket works ... eyes on le console :-||.

How to work this?
-----------------
Seems to work : bundle exec thin -V -R config.ru start

NB: Encountered a multybite error with cramp adding this `#encoding:US-ASCII` seems to fix it :-P
